# rover_ros2
Personal project to give picar-x an ROS2 brain.


My picar-x earned the name Rover, when it arrived from Amazon.  My daughter saw it and yelled "Why did Amazon send us the Mars Rover?"


I started with the pyton tutorial from Sunfounder, but quickly found that to be slow on the pi-zero it came with. In researching that issue, I came across ROS2.  I felt like it would be closer to my ultimate goal (an autonamous lawn cart), and figured Rover would be a good test bed for that.


So, Rover was upgraded to a pi5 and now it is time to get started.
